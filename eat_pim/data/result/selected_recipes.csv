this was my first time making pita bread, so for any of you who are new to making pitas as well, here are some tips for rolling them out.  

if you roll them out to 6-7 inches, they do not puff very much & you can use them like a tortilla.  however, if you roll them a little smaller (some of mine just didn't want to stretch to 6 inches) & have them a little thicker (not too much) they puff up & you can cut them in half for pita pockets.  for some wierd reason, this really impressed me!
